This assignment consists of two parts, both to be completed outside of class time. See the course schedule and Brightspace for exact dates. The rubric is available in Brightspace.
Project Part 1: (No Submission)  
1.	Create the Book class as outlined in the document (recommended filename: book.py).
2.	Test the Book class to verify its correct operation by running the supplied test_book.py program.
3.	Each student is encouraged to individually complete Part 1. At the very least, all group members MUST participate in Part 1.

Project Part 2: (Submission)  
1.	Have one member of your group set up a GitHub repository for Part 2 of this project.  Make sure that this GitHub repository is private.  Add group members and your instructor as collaborators.
2.	Create a separate branch in GitHub for each group member, containing the part they will work on. The branch name should include the task name and the student name.
